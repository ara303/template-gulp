# template-gulp
This is a template (empty) Gulp.js workflow with all the file structure you need to get started with Gulp.js and a number of it's plugins. This uses SCSS with Autoprefixer, concat and minify JS, BrowserSync for automatic page refreshing, and Jekyll to generate a static site or blog.

## How to install

From where you put the files, install dependencies:
